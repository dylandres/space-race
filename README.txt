Our original inspiration stemmed from wanting to build a music-rhythm game from scratch.
The program allows up to 5 players to face-off in a space race, using the keyboard as their controller.
It was built entirely in Python 3 using the .pygame module.
Challenges we ran into included learning Python and using built-in objects within the language such as Sprites.
Accomplishments that we're proud of include learning Python fairly quickly and being able to implement collision detection in our program.
What we learned that coding takes a lot of patience, especially throughout the learning process.
What's next for Space Race? To be expanded to all gaming platforms (including mobile).
